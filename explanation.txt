Alice and Bob are measuring the average wind speed during a cyclone.
They have a machine that gives them hourly wind speed reading.
From previous experience, they know that the average wind speed is between 62
to 88 km/h. They want to know the actual wind speed during the cyclone and they
had 4 machines that gave 10, 20, 50, 100 readings.

Now Alice is a frequentist while Bob believes in the Bayesian method. They both
use statistical inference to find out 95% confidence intervals for the wind speed.

Alice models the readings as a normal distribution and derives a 95% confidence
interval using standard normal distribution
Bob also models the readings as a normal distribution but he can do better.
He knows tht the wind speed is generally between 62 and 88km/h and thus he
assumes a prior distribution of N(75,16) and updates the distribution with each
new data point. Thus, Bob's estimates have relatively have less variance than
Alice's estimates and he gets very accurate estimates even with only 10 data points.
